\title{Function that loads forcings data for Mussel population model and performs the interpolation}
\usage{
Mussel_pop_dataloader(userpath)
}
\arguments{
\item{userpath}{the path where folder containing model inputs and outputs is located}
}
\value{
a list containing the time series in the odd positions and realted forcings in the even positions. Forcings returned are: Water temperature [Celsius degrees], Chlorophyll a concentration [mgChl-a/m^3], particulated organic carbon (POC) concentration [mgC/l] and its characterization in terms of C/P and N/P molar ratios, particulated organic matter (POM) concentration [mgC/l], total suspended solids (TSS) concentration [mg/l]
